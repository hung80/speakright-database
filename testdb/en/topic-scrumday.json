I've been a practitioner and a certified scrum master. At the moment, I am the delivery manager, and a trainer for agile and project management at ELCA. Personally, I also like to be known as a developer and a lifelong learner. So. What is the topic? Imagine the situation when our customer with a fixed budget asks us to commit to delivering a full complex scope. Then we plunge into Agile with all the changes and variations, knowing there is no extra money available. How do we cope with this situation?",

Simply, change must be under control. So the challenge is,  if we try to control the change, how can we employ the best of agile values into prioritizing business values?",

The second challenge is that the customer and the supplier team have to build trust on each other. The very common question is: Is the development team running at the good enough velocity, are they lazy, or are they productive enough? The question that often appears in the mind of the customer is also ' Do I spend my best money for the best values?' And the scarier situation for the customer is when he has no money left but he does not have the result he expects.",

The 2 key elements of these charts are: - Transparency: At any time, all stakeholders should know about the daily plan and velocity of the team.- Predictability: The release plan has to be predictable.

For whatever reason, he cannot spend more than 1 million dollars. So, the burn charts are very helpful to advise about the time and the scope, but if it doesn't have information about the cost, trouble will come. In the chart, we can see the situation when budget is over before we reach to an MVP scope. This is actually the point of the expectation management. If we fail to be transparent enough about the cost, we will have a very upset customer at this point. ",

    "content": "This is a very common pitfall of definition of done, especially in scrum. The timebox concept is good to push the producitivy, but also with the side effect of the 'mostly done' increments. So, to gain a good 'productive burndown chart', the team has tendency to mark it done for 'mostly done' stuffs. In Zombie Scrum, this is also called zombie increments. The features move, but they will never live, and they will fall in the end. The famous situation is that, just before being out of money or deadline is close, we find out that many many things that are claimed to be done, are not really done, and all fall over into the team at a pressured time. The second sydrome is called 'Scrumfall', when definition of done is not strictly followed, it is often that a task is done in this sprint, but is tested in the next sprint. The burndown chart is totally misleading in this case. In the other direction, definition of done is also too ambitious. I have been the scrum master for a project with a strict Definition of done. All done stories were really shippable and we had a new live version of the product at every 2-week sprint. The downside is that there were sprints that the team's motivation was really down as they mostly could not get anything done.",

Definition of done: As mentioned before, in the fixed price contract, definition of done has to be really critical and rigid. So that, the scope is really controlled correctly. Change management: Exchanging removed features for added features is easy to say than do. The change management in this case will become an art. Having said that, study shows that around 80% of features in softwares are rarely used or never used. By smartly prioritizing and changing the features, we can bring the best values for the fixed cost.",

A T&M project may end in a 'sucessful way' like when the customer says 'Ok team, we are happy, but we just do not continue the project from next month' And then he never comes back - Regardless of whatever contract we have, time and material or fixed price, the contracts do not build any trust. People do. So, to win satisfaction, people have to build trust, people have to do expectation management - In the whole seminar, we talk about cost control, sometimes, we mention about expectation management. Actually, they have a very close connection. They all are built on transparency and predictability - The last but not least, in agile world, no change is a no-go. So if we have to fix the scope or the cost, focus on 'how many' we can do, rather than, exactly 'what' we can do. We should always embrace changes in the agile world.
